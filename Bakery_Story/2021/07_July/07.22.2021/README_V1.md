# Bakery Story session July 22nd 2021

<!-- I had a normal session today that lasted less than 10 minutes. I was low on time again today, so I played differently yet again today, making chocolate chip cookies (5 minutes) instead of blueberry muffins (15 minutes) to save time and play more efficiently. I also made the usual batch of coffee. !-->

I had a longer session today, making 1 batches of coffee, and 1 batch of chocolate chip cookies.

## Gifts

I received some parts today, and I also received dishes, including Cappuchino (100x) and Croissant (200x) I had the time to stock the gifts today.

## Tips

My bakery received a lot less tips while I was gone, and it took less than a minute to collect all of it. I collected while I was cooking and brewing to save time.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Crashes

<!-- The game stayed stable and didn't crash today. !-->

The game, as usual, crashed again today.

## Overview
