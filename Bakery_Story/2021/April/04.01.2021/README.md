# Bakery Story session April 1st 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted over 21 minutes (but less than 25 minutes)

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Dishes

I made over 4000 servings of coffee, over 3000 servings of chocolate chip cookies, and over 1000 servings of brownies. No new dishes were created today.

## Revenue

No revenue was made today. I have had my bakery closed for a while so I can stock up lots of food to sell. I have not reached my goal yet to start re-opening.
