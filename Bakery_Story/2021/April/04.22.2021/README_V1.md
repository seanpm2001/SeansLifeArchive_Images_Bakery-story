# Bakery Story session April 22nd 2021

I had a somewhat usual session today, and played for a bit over 18 minutes. Today, I received several new neighbors, and was able to expand my bakery to 20x23 for 20 million coins.

## Gifts

I received many parts, along with 700 plates of hot chocolate, and 50 plates of cappuchino

## Tips

My bakery received dozens of tips while I was gone, and it took a few minutes to collect all of it.

## Remodeling

I expanded my bakery to 20x23 today for 20,000,000 coins, and decorated the bakery with the new design as usual, adding many new tables, and 2 new windows.

## Overview

See above.
