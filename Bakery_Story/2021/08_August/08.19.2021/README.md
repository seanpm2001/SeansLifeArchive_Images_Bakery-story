# Bakery Story session August 19th 2021

<!-- I had a normal session today that lasted less than 10 minutes. I was low on time again today, so I played differently yet again today, making chocolate chip cookies (5 minutes) instead of blueberry muffins (15 minutes) to save time and play more efficiently. I also made the usual batch of coffee. !-->

I had a shorter session today, making 1 batch of coffee (5 minutes each) and 1 batch of chocolate chip cookies (5 minutes each)

## Gifts

I received some parts today, and I didn't receive any dishes. I did not have the time to stock the gifts today.

## Tips

My bakery received a lot less tips while I was gone, and it took less than a minute to collect all of it. <!-- I collected while I was cooking and brewing to save time. !-->

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Crashes

<!-- The game stayed stable and didn't crash today. !-->

The game, as usual, crashed again today.

## Overview

See above.
