# Remodel - March 25th 2021

I spent some time today remodeling my bakery in bakery story. I made it so all food stacked to 1 counter, and I replaced the other counters with tables. I put back some of the original display, and rotated it so it would look better. To me, it looks like a massive improvement.

The drink I used to make all duplicates stack was `mocha` which took 30 minutes to make. I was extremely careful as to not repeat the incident last year with Fashion story. Today was an extended session.
