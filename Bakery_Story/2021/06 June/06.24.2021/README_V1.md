# Bakery Story session June 24th 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted less than 10 minutes. I was low on time again today, so I played differently yet again today, making chocolate chip cookies (5 minutes) instead of blueberry muffins (15 minutes) to save time and play more efficiently. I also made the usual batch of coffee.

## Gifts

I didn't receive any parts today, but I received dishes, including hot chocolate, and chocolate cake. I had the time to stock the gifts today.

## Tips

My bakery received dozens of tips while I was gone, and it took a couple minutes to collect all of it. I collected while I was cooking and brewing to save time.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
